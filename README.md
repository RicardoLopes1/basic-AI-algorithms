# Basic Artificial Intelligence Algorithms

## Vacuum World
<p>
    This is a "clean robot home" project. In this algorithm the robot is in an environment with two rooms, detects if the current room is dirty and clean if necessary.
</p>

## Search without information
<p>
    In this folder we have a few different ways for the Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
</p>
    <a href="search-without-information/dfs_vector.cpp">dfs_vector</a> this is a way to create this algorithm using array structure.<br />
    <a href="search-without-information/dfs_class.cpp">dfs_class</a> it is how to do a DFS using a class.<br />
    And <a href="search-without-information/dfs_arrayOfClass.cpp">dfs_arrayOfClass</a> it is the way to do a DFS using an array of classes.

## Search with information
<p>
    In this folder we have two search algorithms that use heuristics to help decide which way to go. <br />
    Greedy Search Algorithm and A Star Search Algorithm (<b>A*</b>).
</p>
    <a href="search-with-information/greedySearch.cpp">Greedy Search Algorithm</a> is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.<br />
    And <a href="search-with-information/aStar.cpp">A Star Search Algorithm</a> (<b>A*</b>) is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.

## PDF Exercise

`Lab-de-Agentes-VacuumWorld.pdf`, `Lab02-search-without-information.pdf` and `lab4-search-with-information.pdf` are the exercise files where the idea of ​​the algorithms in this repository was obtained.
