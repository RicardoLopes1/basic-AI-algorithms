# Basic Artificial Intelligence Algorithms

## Vacuum World
<p>
    This is a "clean robot home" project. In this algorithm the robot is in an environment with two rooms, detects if the current room is dirty and clean if necessary.
</p>

## Search without information
<p>
    In this folder we have a few different ways for the Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
</p>
    [dfs_vector](search-without-information/dfs_vector.cpp) this is a way to create this algorithm using array structure.<br />
    [dfs_class](search-without-information/dfs_class.cpp) it is how to do a DFS using a class.<br />
    And [dfs_arrayOfClass](search-without-information/dfs_arrayOfClass.cpp) it is the way to do a DFS using an array of classes.

## Search with information
<p>
    In this folder we have two search algorithms that use heuristics to help decide which way to go. <br />
    Greedy Search Algorithm and A Star Search Algorithm (__A*__).
</p>
    [Greedy Search Algorithm](search-with-information/greedySearch.cpp) is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.<br />
    And [A Star Search Algorithm](search-with-information/aStar.cpp) (__A*__) is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.

    ## PDF Exercise

    `Lab-de-Agentes-VacuumWorld`, `Lab02-search-without-information` and `lab4-search-with-information` are the exercise files where the idea of ​​the algorithms in this repository was obtained.
